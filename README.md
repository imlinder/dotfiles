DOTFILES
========

My personal dotfiles

Managed with [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .
```

### Ctrl-w everywhere (MacOS)

Add `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict` with

```
{
    "^w" = "deleteWordBackward:";
}
```

## Todo
